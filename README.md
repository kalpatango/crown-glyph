## Why IAM?

| Problem in vanilla LLMs                               | IAM answer (symbolic / functional)                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Output is limited only by GPU latency.                | **Heartbeat** throttles activity; faster under stress, slower when calm.                |
| Model never pauses to "breathe" or listen.            | **Breath** loop drains and refills *lung capacity*; speech halts when empty.            |
| No energetic cost to thinking or speaking.            | **Blood-O₂** depletes with cognition and word emission; low O₂ forces rest.             |
| Emotions are inferred but never feed back into tempo. | Archetype tag → **BPM + breath rate** map; body reacts to mind.                         |
| Nothing ever *dies*; stakes are zero.                 | If O₂ hits 0 % the heart stops → process terminates. Trust and finitude enter the loop. |
